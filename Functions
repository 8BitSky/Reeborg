#Basic Function Approach
#Completes a Task
#def go_to_goal():
#    repeat 6:
#        move()    
#go_to_goal()

#Data Input Approach
#Completes a task based on input of variable data
#def go_to_goal(distance,speed):
#   think(speed) 
#   for x in range(distance):
#        move()
#go_to_goal(6,10)

#Return Approach
#Does a task and returns data out of the function!
#def steps_to_take():
#    return 6
#
#def go_to_goal(distance):
#    for x in range(distance):
#        move()
#
#steps = steps_to_take()
#go_to_goal(steps)
